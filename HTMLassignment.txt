 1.What  are inline and  block elements in HTML and the difference  between  them.  Name a few inline  elements and block elements.                                          
A block element always begins on a new line, and browsers add a margin  before and after the element by default. A block element always occupies the entire available width.  These are 2 commonly used block elements :                                                                                                                          <p> and <div> 

Here are few block elements : <video> <ul> <nav> <hr> <li>
An inline element occupies space provided to it. It doesn't occupy the whole space as a block element. An inline element cannot contain a block element.                             
Here are few inline elements : <b> <a> <img> <br>      

Difference : 
    Inline Element                       Block Element
Uses the space that is required.    Occupies the entire available space(width).
Cannot contain block elements.      Can contain inline elements.



2.How  to work with images in HTML and explain in detail  <img />  tag important  attributes . 

Images in HTML are displayed using img tag ( <img> ) . The images which are stored in the assets folder are used in this tag. 
The syntax of this tag is : <img src="" alt="" /> 
Here important attributes are “src’’ and “alt”. Where src means source of the image and alt means alternative to the image if the image is not displayed by any chance. 


3.How  to create  lists in HTML.  
Lists in HTML can be created using <ol> and <ul> tags. Where <ol> stands for ordered list and <ul> stands for unordered list. 
List items are displayed using <li> tag. Each list item has its own <li> tag.
Here is an example of creating a list in HTML :
        <ul>
          <li><a href="">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="">About</a></li>
          <li><a href="">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
